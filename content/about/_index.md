I am the neighbor that decorates your house because she's run out of wall space at home. I've always been a maker, starting with model airplanes and balsa wood and then progressing to nail art and scrapbooking. As my scrapbooks filled and subjects grew older, I started looking for new ways to express my creativity. I've always loved beaches and they serve as inspiration for much of my art and steered me toward mixed media and resin art. I grew up close to the beach and resin art scenes and waves bring me back to the beaches I love.
